# Simple GUI Music Player

This is a simple GUI music player created as a project for an introduction to programming class. The program is written in Ruby and uses the Gosu library for its graphical interface.

## What it does

The music player has a basic user interface with controls for playing music. It supports different genres of music such as Null, Pop, Classic, Jazz, and Rock. The interface includes different containers for artwork, main controls, track list, volume control, and a footer. The dimensions and positions of these containers are defined in the code.

## How to run the program

To run the program, you need to have Ruby and Gosu installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can install them as follows:

### Windows
#### 1. Install Ruby
  - Visit https://rubyinstaller.org/
  - Download the latest version of the Ruby+Devkit installer (for example, Ruby+Devkit 3.x.x-x (x64)).
  - Run the installer to install Ruby (Ensure "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" is checked)
#### 2. Install MSYS2 and Development Toolchain:
    - After the installation completes, ensure "Run 'ridk install' to set up MSYS2 and development toolchain" is checked and click Finish
    - A command prompt will open. Press Enter to proceed with the default option (1: MSYS2 base installation).
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the MSYS2 installation.
    - When prompted, press Enter to proceed with installing the required tools and components.
#### 3. Verify installation
  - To check the Ruby version, run `ruby -v`. This should display the Ruby version installed.
